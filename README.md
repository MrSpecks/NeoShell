## Overview

This tool is a high-performance, intelligent **CMS Reconnaissance & Webshell Payload Generator** designed for authorized penetration testing engagements. It detects the backend technologies used by a wide range of websites‚Äîincluding PHP, JSP, Java EE, React, Vue, WordPress, and custom stacks‚Äîand generates tailored webshell payloads based on CMS and stack fingerprinting.

Built with concurrency in mind, this tool is meant for offensive security professionals and red teamers who need **automated payload generation** at scale, with **conditional deployment logic** based on target characteristics and real-time detection signals.

## Key Features

- **CMS & Stack Detection**
  - Fingerprints CMS and frameworks (WordPress, JSP, React, etc.)
  - Passive detection via headers, DOM clues, and paths
- **Custom Payload Matching**
  - Loads dynamic payloads based on tech stack
  - Saves webshells locally for manual or automated drop
- **Concurrency & Scaling**
  - Async or thread-based architecture for mass site scanning
- **Conditional Logic**
  - Only drops payload if target meets detection criteria
- **Extensibility**
  - Modular payload system (JSON/YAML)
  - Easy to integrate new CMS or tech stacks
- **Logging & Reporting**
  - Saves recon and payload activity to timestamped files

---

## Use Case

This tool is ideal for:

- Penetration testers working under legal contracts
- Offensive security engineers building recon automation
- Bug bounty hunters needing rapid CMS identification
- Red team toolchains requiring webshell generation logic

---

## How It Works

1. You feed it a list of target domains or subdomains.
2. It fingerprints each target for CMS/stack using multiple methods.
3. Based on the result, it matches and prepares a fitting webshell payload.
4. Payloads are saved locally and can be optionally deployed in post-exploitation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/MrSpecks/NeoShell.git
   cd NeoShell
```

### **1.Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: If pip fails, try python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt.

### **2.Verify the installation**
```bash
python neoshell.py --help
```
---

## Usage**

### **Running a Scan**

Start a recon scan by providing a list of target URLs and a scan profile:
```bash 
python neoshell.py --targets targets.txt --profile aggressive
```

Profiles: Aggressive maximizes speed; passive prioritizes stealth.

## **Available Commands**
--targets <file>: Input file with target URLs (e.g., targets.txt).
--profile <profile>: Scan profile (aggressive, passive, etc.).
--output <directory>: Output directory for reports.
--help: Display help and options.

### **Example Output**
```bash
$ python neoshell.py --help
NeoShell v1.0 - CMS Recon & Webshell Payload Generator
Usage: neoshell.py [options]
...
```

## **Configuration**
### **Payload Settings**
Configure NeoShell to deploy specific payloads based on CMS type, version, or detected plugins in config.json. The default_payload is used when no specific match is found.
```json
{
  "payloads": {
    "wordpress": ["wp-shell.php", "wp-reverse-shell.php"],
    "joomla": ["joomla-shell.php"]
  },
  "default_payload": "wp-shell.php",
  "log_config": {
    "path": "logs/",
    "format": "timestamped"
  }
}
```
Note: Validate changes with a JSON linter to avoid errors.

### **Logging**
Logs are generated in the logs/ directory by default. Modify log_config in config.json to change the path or format.
